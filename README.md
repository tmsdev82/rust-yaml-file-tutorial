# Read and write to a YAML file with Rust

This repo is a small example of how to read from a YAML file and deserialize the data to an object. It also shows how to update the object and save it to a new YAML file.

This project is the result of an article on my blog: [How to read and write YAML in Rust with Serde](https://tms-dev-blog.com/how-to-read-and-write-yaml-in-rust-with-serde/)

## Running the project

This is a very simple project and requires no configuration:

```bash
cargo run
```
